# XSharedCockpit-Lua
This is a new plugin for xplane that aims to allow simmers to share a cockpit - similar to smartcopilot

Note: This plugin doesn't have a GUI yet. It's (sorta) useless as of now. The GUI will allow this plugin to be used, similar to smartcopilot's direct connect feature

In the future, a GUI will be added to allow the user to connect to computers that are not on localhost(basically only itself). 

Support for smartcopilot.cfg files will also be added, allowing the plugin to sync all required datarefs in order to have a "complete" plugin

(Someone please help me with the README and descriptions I have no idea what I'm doing)

I'm discontinuing support for this version of the plugin, because of horrific performance issues that can't really be resolved with the Lua engine. Instead, I am going to translate and continue this on a different C++ repo in the near future. If you know what you're doing, download this and give it a shot, if you don't care about the performance impact or have a really powerful CPU. Enjoy!
