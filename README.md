# XSharedCockpit
This is a new plugin for xplane that aims to allow simmers to share a cockpit - similar to smartcopilot

Note: This plugin doesn't have a GUI yet. It's (sorta) useless as of now. The GUI will allow this plugin to be used, similar to smartcopilot's direct connect feature

In the future, a GUI will be added to allow the user to connect to computers that are not on localhost(basically only itself). 

Support for smartcopilot.cfg files will also be added, allowing the plugin to sync all required datarefs in order to have a "complete" plugin

Additionally, this plugin is available as a public repo on github over here, if you want to contribute to this project
