# XSharedCockpit-Lua
This is a new plugin for xplane that aims to allow simmers to share a cockpit - similar to smartcopilot

Note: This plugin doesn't have a GUI. There are registered commands and FlyWithLua Macros in order to start/stop the server and clear overrides. To edit master address, port, slave address, port you will have to edit XSharedCockpit.lua

Note: This plugin doesn't have a GUI

(Someone please help me with the README and descriptions I have no idea what I'm doing)

I'm discontinuing support for this version of the plugin, because of horrific performance issues that can't really be resolved with the Lua engine. Instead, I am going to translate and continue this on a different C++ repo in the near future. If you know what you're doing, download this and give it a shot, if you don't care about the performance impact or have a really powerful CPU. Enjoy!
